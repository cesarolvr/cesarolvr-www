                  Today marks one month since I started studying programming.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                  Everything has been quite challenging, and it seems that I am
                  not well-suited for this course.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                  As context, my mother forced me that I enroll in this public
                  technical school in our state. This decision will help reduce
                  expenses and, of course, assist me in entering the job market.
                  She chose the course for me: <strong>Computing</strong>, and
                  it's weird because I didn't even have a computer at home. So I
                  entered the course completely raw.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                  This school combines traditional high school subjects with
                  specialized computer science courses. Consequently, in
                  addition to physics, chemistry, and mathematics, the
                  curriculum also includes{" "}
                  <strong>computer fundamentals</strong>,{" "}
                  <strong>database modeling</strong>, <strong>networks</strong>,{" "}
                  <strong>robotics</strong>, <strong>programming logic</strong>,{" "}
                  <strong>programming languages</strong>,{" "}
                  <strong>algorithms and data structures</strong>, among others.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                  I am lucky to have friends who are already "indie hackers" and
                  are well-versed in technology, which allows them to assist me.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                  I don't think this is the right fit for me, but I will
                  continue since I don't have the time to pivot and explore
                  other areas.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                  I will continue studying, even if I do not fully understand
                  the whole and the purpose of programming.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>Wish me luck!</p>
