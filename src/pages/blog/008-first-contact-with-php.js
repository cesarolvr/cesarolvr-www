                  So, I'm trying to create a website for my teacher's cake business, and I decided to dive into PHP. The reason? I was told it's a good way to build web applications (like Facebook).
                </p>
                <br />
                <p className="mb-4">
                  I started by figuring out where this code should run. That simple question always guides me when I'm programming. Where, when, how many times, and why are important things to understand before diving into the code itself.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p className="mb-4">
                  Apparently, it runs inside a server. So, I had to set up a server and then put the code inside it to be interpreted.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p className="mb-4">
                  Of course, the first thing I did was try to get something, <em>anything</em>, to show up on the screen!
                </p>
                <br />
                <p className="mb-4">
                  To do that, I created a file named <code>index.php</code> with the following content:
                </p>
                <br />
                <SyntaxHighlighter
                  language="php"
                  style={darcula}
                  className="my-4 overflow-scroll rounded-3xl"
                >
                  {`<?php
echo "Hello, World!";
?>`}
                </SyntaxHighlighter>
                <br />
                <p className="mb-4">
                  <code>echo</code> is the command that tells PHP to output the text "Hello, World!" to the browser.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p className="mb-4">
                  I discovered PHP has a built-in web server for testing purposes. It's simpler than setting up a full server stack. You can start it with this command in your project directory:
                </p>
                <br />
                <SyntaxHighlighter
                  language="bash"
                  style={darcula}
                  className="my-4 overflow-scroll rounded-3xl"
                >
                  {`php -S localhost:8000`}
                </SyntaxHighlighter>
                <br />
                <p className="mb-4">
                  Then, you can access your site at <code>http://localhost:8000</code>.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p className="mb-4">
                  With this "Hello, World!", my plan now is to discover how to generate HTML with PHP so I can actually build a website for her.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p className="mb-4">
                  No idea how to put this website online and make it accessible from outside my computer.
                </p>
                <br />
