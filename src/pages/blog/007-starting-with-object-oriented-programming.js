                  I started diving into object-oriented programming (OOP) with Java, and honestly, it feels like a whole new level of coding.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-4">
                  So far, my goal is just stringing together lines of code freely and giving space to my creativity. But this week, I had to create these "objects", and each one has its own data and actions it can perform.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p className="mb-4">
                  The first thing that started to make sense was the idea of a "class". Think of it like a blueprint. I can create a <code>Dog</code> class, and it has characteristics like <code>breed</code>, <code>age</code>, and <code>name</code>. It can also <em>do</em> things, like <code>bark()</code> or <code>wagTail()</code>.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-4">
                  Then I can make a bunch of <code>Dog</code> objects, and each one can have its own <code>breed</code>, <code>age</code>, and <code>name</code>.
                </p>
                <br />
                <SyntaxHighlighter
                  language="java"
                  style={darcula}
                  className="my-4 overflow-scroll rounded-3xl"
                >
                  {`public class Dog {
    private String breed;
    private int age;
    private String name;
    
    public Dog(String breed, int age, String name) {
        this.breed = breed;
        this.age = age;
        this.name = name;
    }
    
    public void bark() {
        System.out.println(name + " says: Woof!");
    }
    
    public void wagTail() {
        System.out.println(name + " is wagging its tail!");
    }
}`}
                </SyntaxHighlighter>
                <br />
                <p className="mb-4">
                  I noticed that every time my teacher gives easy examples. Or maybe when she explains things, everything becomes easy... Anyway, what about putting into a class a "touch screen"? What's the function of that? Show images? Allow something else to touch on it? But is it the screen's function or is it someone else's hands function? I have no clues.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p className="mb-4">
                  Then there's "encapsulation." It's like bundling everything related to an object together and keeping some of it private. It's supposed to be cleaner and easier to manage...
                </p>
                <br />
                <p className="mb-4">
                  "Inheritance" is pretty cool too. It means one class can inherit stuff from another class. So, a <code>BrazilianFila</code> class can inherit all the basic <code>GuardBreed</code> stuff, but also have its own unique characteristics. It's like building on top of what's already there.
                </p>
                <br />
                <SyntaxHighlighter
                  language="java"
                  style={darcula}
                  className="my-4 overflow-scroll rounded-3xl"
                >
                  {`public class GuardBreed extends Dog {
    public void guard() {
        System.out.println(name + " is guarding the property!");
    }
}

public class BrazilianFila extends GuardBreed {
    public void loyalProtection() {
        System.out.println(name + " shows extreme loyalty to family!");
    }
}`}
                </SyntaxHighlighter>
                <br />
                <p className="mb-4">
                  And finally, "polymorphism." This one's a bit trickier, but it's about objects being able to take on different forms. So, if I have a method that expects a <code>GuardBreed</code>, I can also pass it a <code>BrazilianFila</code> because a <code>BrazilianFila</code> <em>is</em> a <code>GuardBreed</code>.
